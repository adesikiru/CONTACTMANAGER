No Homebrew Needed: How to Install MongoDB on Mac (M1, M2, M3, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air) Without Homebrew and Configure in Zsh!* üöÄüñ•Ô∏è

If you prefer not to use Homebrew, you can manually download and install MongoDB on your Mac. Additionally, we'll cover setting up MongoDB in the Zsh shell.

üåü *Step-by-Step Guide:*
1. *Download MongoDB:*
Visit the official MongoDB website (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/...) and download the MongoDB Community Server for macOS.

2. *Extract the Archive:*
Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file (usually a .tgz or .tar.gz archive) and extract it. You can do this by double-clicking on the file or using the terminal:
     ```bash
     tar -zxvf /path/to/downloaded/mongodb-osx-ssl-x86_64-4.x.x.tgz
     ```

3. *Move MongoDB to /usr/local:*
Move the extracted MongoDB folder to `/usr/local` for easier access:
     ```bash
     sudo mv mongodb-osx-ssl-x86_64-4.x.x /usr/local/mongodb
     ```

4. *Create Data Directory:*
MongoDB requires a data directory. Create one using:
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/var/mongodb
     ```

5. *Set Permissions:*
Set proper permissions for the data directory:
     ```bash
     sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/var/mongodb
     ```

6. *Add MongoDB Binaries to PATH:*
To access MongoDB from any location in the terminal, add the MongoDB binaries to your shell's PATH. If you're using Zsh, edit your Zsh configuration file (usually `~/.zshrc`):
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc
     ```
     Add the following line at the end:
     ```bash
     export PATH="/usr/local/mongodb/bin:$PATH"
     ```
     Save and exit.

7. *Restart Zsh or Source the Configuration:*
Restart Zsh or source the updated configuration:
     ```bash
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

8. *Start MongoDB:*
Start MongoDB by running:
     ```bash
     mongod --dbpath /usr/local/var/mongodb
     ```

9. *Verify Installation:*
Open a new terminal window and run the MongoDB shell:
     ```bash
     mongo
     ```
     You should see the MongoDB shell prompt.

10. *Explore MongoDB:*
You're ready to explore MongoDB! Use commands like `show dbs` and `use your_database_name` to get started.

11. *Stop MongoDB (Optional):*
If you want to stop MongoDB, press *Ctrl + C* in the terminal where MongoDB is running.

üöÄ *Additional Tips:*
*Configure MongoDB as a Service (Optional):*
To run MongoDB as a service, create a launch agent plist file. Refer to the MongoDB documentation for detailed instructions.

*Upgrade MongoDB Version:*
To upgrade MongoDB, download the latest version, repeat the installation steps, and replace the old binaries.

üçÉ *Congratulations! You've successfully installed MongoDB on your Mac without Homebrew and configured it to work seamlessly with Zsh!*
